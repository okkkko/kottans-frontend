## Git Basics
I already know a little about Git but the course at UDACITY and learngitbranching.js.org helped me better understand the basic concepts of Git and what a powerful and at the same time flexible this tool is.

Also, I've learned a lot of new useful commands, and put my knowledge in some order.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
#### Linux CLI
During the Linux Survival tutorial I've learned basic commands, find out about security mode, and how to change it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't practice Linux commands properly, since I am a Windows user. But if I should work with Linux in the future, it won`t be so new to me.

#### HTTP

The articles are very interesting. Now I have a general idea of HTTP and HTTPS. Definitely, I'll come back to this later for a better understanding.

## Git Collaboration
After this course, I feel much more comfortable working with remote repositories. 

Also, I have learned how to contribute to a public project in the right way and some cool rebase commands.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
Most of this information was familiar to me, but it was nice to refresh my knowledge.

Also, I didn't know anything about grid, now I understand how it works and I intend to use it in the future.
