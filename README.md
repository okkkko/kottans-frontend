### Git Basics
I already know a little about Git but the course at UDACITY and learngitbranching.js.org helped me better understand the basic concepts of Git and what a powerful and at the same time flexible this tool is.

Also, I've learned a lot of new useful commands, and put my knowledge in some order.
